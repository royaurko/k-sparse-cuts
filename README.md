##Description

A python 3 implementation of the [LRTV algorithm](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.0965v1.pdf) 
which uses a higher order Cheeger inequality to generate **k-sparse-cuts**. This is still 
a work in progress and is mainly meant for my research purposes. 

##TODO

Check for bugs, when run for 1 trial on 1-dim grid graphs, all returned cuts have sparsity 1 (fishy).
